Comments:
    This sample is only for testing purposes.  It uses the resistivity
    term in module Magnetic as ordinary diffusion equations.  A delta
    function is put in the center of the grid initially, where its
    diffusion is analytically known.
    The algorithm is described in and has been applied to the work
    listed in References.
