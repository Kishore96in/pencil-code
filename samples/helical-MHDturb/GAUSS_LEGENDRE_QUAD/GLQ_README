The provided mathematica notebook generates the
"gauss_legendre_quadrature.dat" file that can be imported
using lread_gauss_quadrature=T in run.in.
The output directory is the same as the notebook's directory.

To approximate the definite integral of f(x), we have
\int_{-1}^1 f(x) dx
=\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i)*w_i
where n is the number of sample points used,
x_i is the ith zero point of the nth-order Legendre polynomial,
and w_i is the associated weight.
The generated file "gauss_legendre_quadrature.dat" provides
such a table of {n,x_i,w_i}, with desired digits of precision,
where n runs from 1 to nmax (adjustable).
The generated files are labeld by nmax and the precision; for example
gauss_legendre_quadrature_n32p32.dat
means nmax=32 and the number of digits of precision is 32.
The first line of the file gives nmax, then 2*nmax*nmax lines follow.
Putting those 2*nmax*nmax lines into nmax groups,
in the nth group, the first 2n numbers gives n pairs {x_i,w_i}, where
x_i = the ith zero point the nth-order Legendre polynomial, and
w_i = the weight of x_i for the Gauss-Legendre quadrature.
The rest (2*nmax-2*n) elements are filled with zeros.
