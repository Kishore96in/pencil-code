Added:
    Before 09-Feb-2023 
Status:
    Has been revised and is working in this form since 09-Feb-2023
    debugged eosperturb and eoscalc in eos_ionization
    replaced shock with shock high order 
    fixed obsolete interstellar settings
Recommended resolution:
    at least 0.5x0.5x2.0 kiloparsecs domain (maintain grid resolution <= 0.004 for larger Lx,Ly)
Comments:
    The initial condition ferriere is out of equilibrium and should be
    replaced with a hydrostatic steady 1D state in entropy and density with
    identical size vertical grid and hydrodynamic run parameters. See
    ${PENCIL_HOME}/samples/supernova-driven-turbulence/1Dhd_equidistant
    Magnetic fields and cosmic rays can be added to this 3D model
    
    To obtain the 1D data file run
    > python ism_save.dat
    from the command line then copy the init_ism.dat file into the new 3D run
    directory
