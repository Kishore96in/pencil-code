Recommended resolution:
    None. Varying the resolution is a good test of how many grid points the
    code needs to resolve a self-gravitating shear wave.

Comments:
    Linear test problem for gas self-gravity in the shearing sheet. A leading
    shear wave is swung around by the Keplerian shear and amplified by
    self-gravity.  One can compare the numerical solution to the result of a
    numerical integration of the linearised equation system, produced by the
    IDL script shear_wave.pro (in the idl/ directory).

    [PAB] 25-Mar-2023:
    I fixed an issue the 'fourier_shift_yz_y' routines, where processors were
    calculating something, even though they should not participate in the FFT.
    Not sure if the current output or the old "reference.out" is right.
    Anders, please check.
