Recommended resolution:
    32x32x1 for nu=eta=1e-2 is fine.
Comments:
    This is a chiral MHD run with an initial seed magnetic field
    and an initial chiral asymmetry (mu5). 
    The nonzero mu5 leads to an instability in the magnetic field,
    that has a maximum growth rate of eta*mu5^2/4 rate which is attained
    on the wavenumber k=mu5/2. Therefore, to have this chiral dynamo 
    instability within the box, the initial value of mu5 should be 
    between 1 and approximately less than 16 (for a resolution of 32).
