This directory contains tutorials for using Python with your Pencil Code
simulations. They are mostly written as Jupyter documents.

While Jupyter is /not/ a requirement for using the Pencil Code Python scripts
and modules, we will assume here that you know how to use it.


~ Task 1: Get yourself informed on Jupyter


Now that you know what Jupyter is, ensure you have it installed on your
computer. You get it by default when using Anaconda as your Python
distribution.


~ Task 2: Check if Jupyter is running correctly. Normally this should be possible
by using 'ipython notebook' (or 'jupyter-notebook') from your shell prompt.


Note: If you are trying to run these tutorials on a distant cluster you are
connected to via ssh, this may not work. Instead try what is written in the
tutorial basics/Jupyter_on_a_cluster.


TUTORIAL OVERVIEW:

The tutorials are grouped as follows:

basics                Using 'pencil' and Jupyter/Python in general.
                      Basics and neat tricks await you here.
red                   Using 'pencil' to read in your simulation data.
visualize             Using 'pencil' to visualize your data.
simulation_objects    Using the full capacity of the 'pencil' simulation
                      objects.

You can now go and check them out. Feel free to add you own tutorials or request
them from the Pencil Code Community.

Tutorials may use dummy/sample simulations. You find them in the
sample_simulations folder.
