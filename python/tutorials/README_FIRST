Dear Pencil Code User,

this directory contains tutorials for using Python with your Pencil Code
simulations. They are mostly written as Jupyter documents. If you dont know
Jupyter yet you should definitly check it out before you continue!


~ Task 1: Get yourself informed on Jupyter


Now that you know what Jupyter is, ensure you have it installed on your
computer. You get it by default when using Anaconda as you Python distribution,
what is what I do recommend to you.


~ Task 2: Check if Jupyter is running correctly. Normally this should be possible
by using 'ipython notebook' (or 'jupyter-notebook') in your bash shell.


Note: If you are trying to do these tutorials on a distant cluster you are connected
to via ssh, this may not work. Instead try what is written in the tutorial basics/Jupyter_on_a_cluster.


TUTORIAL OVERVIEW:

The tutorials are grouped as follows:

basics                On using pencil and Jupyter/Python in general.
                      Basics and neat tricks await you here.
red                   On using pencil to READ in your simulation data.
visualize             On using pencil to VISUALIZE your data.
simulation_objects    On using the full capacity of the pencil simulation objects.

Now go and check them out! Feel free to add you own tutorials or request them from the Pencil Code Community! 

Tutorials may use dummy/sample simulations. You find them in the
sample_simulations folder.
