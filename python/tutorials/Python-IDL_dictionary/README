A large array of idl scripts have been developed over the years, and
many of them served their purpose at the time, but there are many others
of general purpose. Below is a small selection of examples of idl call
sequences along with their python counterparts.

Here are the links to a few potentially useful sites:
1) IDL to Python bridge: https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/docs/IDLToPython.html
2) IDL commands in numerical Python: http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/idl-python-xref.pdf
