If you wish to add/edit Python tutorials make sure you adhere to the
PC Python coding style which can be found here:
https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/wiki/PythonCodingStyle

Tutorials can be written as Jupyter files or as .py script files.
We aim to have both formats avialable. So, if you write the tutorial
as Jupyter notebook convert to a Python script using:
jupyter nbconvert --to script JUPYTER_SCRIPT.ipynb
