## Work done

1.  Wrote a cyclic-imports script (`python/utils/cyclic-imports`).
    Currently there are a *lot* of cycles (some of these might be
    legitimate, but not sure)
    -   A lot of clean-up of existing imports (hope I didn't break
        anything)

    -   Nothing serious so far, except for extracting `is_sim_dir()` to a new
        package `pencil/util` that must not import from other `pencil`
        packages.

    -   Removed `lapack/pidly/pidly.py` (verbatim copy of `lapack/pidly.py`)

2.  Started to write tests (including import tests, though those are
    maybe not very conclusive) for basic functionality.
    -   Imports inside functions cannot be tested without calling all
        functions.

3.  Tried to fix `pencil/calc/example_shocktube.py`

4.  Reformatted `pencil/calc/streamlines`, `pencil/calc/tensors`,
    `pencil/read/power` using *black* [for demonstration purposes].


## Suggestions

1.  Suggestions
    1.  Replace `from ..sim import simulations` with
        `from pencil.sim import simulations`

    2.  Avoid side effects from `import pencil as pc`
        -   “pencil\_old” advice
        -   Whatever complains about my MIT MAGIC COOKIE
        -   Import of virtually any module takes ~ 4s (as `pencil/__init__.py`
            is always imported
        -   This is very annoying when I just want to run a test.
        -   I think we should have the basic package structure `pencil/...`,
            and for interactive use we call something like

                from pencil import interactive
                from pencil import session
                from pencil import pc_lab

                from pencil_interactive import *

            or some such.

2.  What does `backpack` stand for?
    “Third-party module, tribute to the author!”
    → why not call it `third_party`, then?

3.  Move description of submodules into respective `__init__.py` (from
    `pencil/__init__.py`)
