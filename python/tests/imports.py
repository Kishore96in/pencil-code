"""Test Python imports.

Note: Given that Python tries to avoid importing the same module twice,
any repeated imports listed here (e.g. 'from pencil.sim import
simulation' followed by 'from pencil.sim.get', where get.py imports
simulation.py) may actually test a lot less than one would expect.
  It would be better to start a new Python process for each import, but
currently the latency of importing pencil is about 4 seconds, so these
tests would take a significant amount of time.

Note 2: The tests here are used to ensure that functionality is not quietly
removed when refactoring the Python modules.
  However, being listed here does not automatically declare an import
meaningful and important. Any import listed here that does not make sense,
can be removed in the code, provided these tests get adapted.
