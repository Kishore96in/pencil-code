Directory pencil-code/python/utils.

This directory contains utility scripts (and maybe modules) for analyzing
coding aspects of the Pencil Code python files.
  These will not be of much interest to the users of the Python modules and
scripts, nor will they necessarily work without some extra packages and
sufficiently recent Python versions..
  You do not want to include this directory into your PATH or PYTHONPATH.
