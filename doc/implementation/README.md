Pencil Code Implementation Notes
--------------------------------

This directory is contains implementation notes for special
solvers, algorithms, boundary conditions, etc.
These notes tend to be more specialized than what is documented
in the manual.
As always, to have definitive information on what is really done in
the code, it is necessary to check on the actual source code and the
comments therein.
