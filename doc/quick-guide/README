The purpose of the quick start guide is to provide students with a minimalistic
roadmap for their first contact  with the pencil code. It should be as general as
possible.
During the pencil code meeting 2012 it was decided this document should not be
longer than 6-7 pages, so it does not defeat its own purpose.
At no time should it ever contain documentation, which is not in the manual.

27-nov-20/axel: The text is now a little over 7 pages after the JOSS referee
requested sample output for comparison.
