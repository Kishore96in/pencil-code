Quick start guide
*****************

Required software
=================

Linux
-----

A Fortran and a C compiler are needed to compile the code. Both
compilers should belong to the same distribution package and version
(e.g. GNU GCC or Intel).

MacOS X
-------

For Mac, you first need to install Xcode from the website
http://developer.apple.com/, where you have to register as a member.
Alternatively, an easy to install ``gfortran`` binary package can be
found at the website http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries. Just
download the archive and use the installer contained therein. It
installs into ‘``/usr/local/gfortran``’ with a symbolic link in
‘``/usr/local/bin/gfortran``’. It might be necessary to add the
following line to the “``.cshrc``”-file in your ‘``/home``’ folder:

::

     setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:\$PATH

Download the Pencil Code
========================

The Pencil Code is an open source code written mainly in Fortran and
available under GPL. General information can be found at our official
homepage:

http://pencil-code.nordita.org/.

The latest version of the code can be downloaded with ``svn``. In the
directory where you want to put the code, type:

::

     svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk/ pencil-code

Alternatively, you may also use ``git``:

::

     git clone https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code.git

More details on download options can be found here:
http://pencil-code.nordita.org/download.php

The downloaded ‘``pencil-code``’ directory contains several
sub-directories:

#. ‘``doc``’: you may build the latest manual as PDF by issuing the
   command ``make`` inside this directory

#. ‘``samples``’: contains many sample problems

#. ‘``config``’: has all the configuration files

#. ‘``src``’: the actual source code

#. ‘``bin``’ and ‘``lib``’: supplemental scripts

#. ‘``idl``’, ‘``python``’, ‘``julia``’, etc.: data processing for
   diverse languages

Configure the shell environment
===============================

You need to load some environment variables into your shell. Please
change to the freshly downloaded directory:

::

     cd pencil-code

Probably you use a ``sh``-compatible shell (like the Linux default shell
``bash``), there you just type:

::

     . sourceme.sh

(In a ``csh``-compatible shell, like ``tcsh``, use this alternative:
``source sourceme.csh`` )

Your first simulation run
=========================

Create a new run-directory
--------------------------

Now create a run-directory and clone the input and configuration files
from one of the samples that fits you best to get started quickly (here
from ‘``pencil-code/samples/1d-tests/jeans-x``’):

::

     mkdir -p /data/myuser/myrun/src
     cd /data/myuser/myrun
     cp $PENCIL_HOME/samples/1d-tests/jeans-x/*.in ./
     cp $PENCIL_HOME/samples/1d-tests/jeans-x/src/*.local src/

Your run should be put outside of your ‘``/home``’ directory, if you
expect to generate a lot of data and you have a tight storage quota in
your ‘``/home``’.

Linking to the sources
----------------------

One command sets up all needed symbolic links to the original Pencil
Code directory:

::

     pc_setupsrc

Makefile and parameters
-----------------------

Two basic configuration files define a simulation setup:
“``src/Makefile.local``” contains a list of modules that are being used,
and “``src/cparam.local``” defines the grid size and the number of
processors to be used. Take a quick look at these files...

Single-processor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example “``src/Makefile.local``” using the module for only one
processor would look like:

::

     MPICOMM=nompicomm

For most modules there is also a “``no``”-variant which switches that
functionality off.

In “``src/cparam.local``” the number of processors needs to be set to
``1`` accordingly:

::

     integer, parameter :: ncpus=1,nprocx=1,nprocy=1,nprocz=ncpus/(nprocx*nprocy)
     integer, parameter :: nxgrid=128,nygrid=1,nzgrid=128

Multi-processor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you like to use MPI for multi-processor simulations, be sure that you
have a MPI library installed and change “``src/Makefile.local``” to use
MPI:

::

     MPICOMM=mpicomm

Change the ``ncpus`` setting in “``src/cparam.local``”. Think about how
you want to distribute the volume on the processors — usually, you
should have 128 grid points in the x-direction to take advantage of the
SIMD processor unit. For compilation, you have to use a configuration
file that includes the “``_MPI``” suffix, see below.

Compiling...
------------

In order to compile the code, you can use a pre-defined configuration
file corresponding to your compiler package. E.g. the default compilers
are ``gfortran`` together with ``gcc`` and the code is being built with
default options (not using MPI) by issuing the command:

::

     pc_build

Alternatively, for multi-processor runs (still using the default GNU-GCC
compilers):

::

     pc_build -f GNU-GCC_MPI

Using a different compiler (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you prefer to use a different compiler package (e.g. with MPI support
or using ``ifort``), you may try:

::

     pc_build -f Intel
     pc_build -f Intel_MPI
     pc_build -f Cray
     pc_build -f Cray_MPI

More pre-defined configurations are found in the directory
“``pencil-code/config/compilers/*.conf``”.

Changing compiler options (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of course you can also create a configuration file in any subdirectory
of ‘``pencil-code/config/hosts/``’. By default, ``pc_build`` looks for a
config file that is based on your ``host-ID``, which you may see with
the command:

::

     pc_build -i

You may add your modified configuration with the filename
“``host-ID.conf``”, where you can change compiler options according to
the Pencil Code manual. A good host configuration example, that you may
clone and adapt according to your needs, is
“``pencil-code/config/hosts/IWF/host-andromeda-GNU_Linux-Linux.conf``”.

Running...
----------

The initial conditions are set in “``start.in``” and the parameters for
the main simulation run can be found in “``run.in``”. In “``print.in``”
you can choose which quantities are written to the file
“``data/time_series.dat``”.

Be sure you have created an empty ‘``data``’ directory.

::

     mkdir data

It is now time to run the code:

::

     pc_run

If everything worked well, your output should contain the line

::

     start.x has completed successfully

after initializing everything successfully. It would then start running,
printing in the console the quantities specified in “``print.in``”, for
instance,

::

   ---it--------t-------dt------rhom------urms------uxpt-----uypt-----uzpt-----
          0      0.00 4.9E-03 1.000E+00  1.414E+00 2.00E+00 0.00E+00 0.00E+00
         10      0.05 4.9E-03 1.000E+00  1.401E+00 1.98E+00 0.00E+00 0.00E+00
         20      0.10 4.9E-03 1.000E+00  1.361E+00 1.88E+00 0.00E+00 0.00E+00 
         .......

ending with

::

     Simulation finished after        xxxx  time-steps
     .....
     Wall clock time/timestep/meshpoint [microsec] = ...

An empty file called “``COMPLETED``” will appear in your run directory
once the run is finished.

If you work with one of the samples or an identical setup in a new
working directory, you can verify the correctness of the results by
checking against reference data, delivered with each sample:

::

     diff reference.out data/time_series.dat

Welcome to the world of Pencil Code!

Troubleshooting...
------------------

If compiling fails, please try the following — with or without the
optional ``_MPI`` for MPI runs:

::

     pc_build --cleanall
     pc_build -f GNU-GCC_MPI

If some step still fails, you may report to our mailing list:
http://pencil-code.nordita.org/contact.php. In your report, please state
the exact point in this quick start guide that fails for you (including
the full error message) — and be sure you precisely followed all
non-optional instructions from the beginning.

In addition to that, please report your operating system (if not
Linux-based) and the shell you use (if not ``bash``). Also please give
the full output of these commands:

::

     bash
     cd path/to/your/pencil-code/
     source sourceme.sh
     echo $PENCIL_HOME
     ls -la $PENCIL_HOME/bin
     cd samples/1d-tests/jeans-x/
     gcc --version
     gfortran --version
     pc_build --cleanall
     pc_build -d

If you plan to use MPI, please also provide the full output of:

::

     mpicc --version
     mpif90 --version
     mpiexec --version

Data post-processing
====================

IDL visualization (optional,)
-----------------------------------------

GUI-based visualization (recommended for quick inspection)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most simple approach to visualize a Cartesian grid setup is to run
the Pencil Code GUI and to select the files and physical quantities you
want to see:

::

   IDL> .r pc_gui

If you miss some physical quantities, you might want to extend the two
IDL routines ``pc_get_quantity`` and ``pc_check_quantities``. Anything
implemented there will be available in the GUI, too.

Command-line based processing of “big data”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please check the documentation inside these files:

+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
|``pencil-code/idl/read/pc_read_var_raw.pro``    | efficient reading of raw data              |
+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
|``pencil-code/idl/read/pc_read_subvol_raw.pro`` | reading of sub-volumes                     |
+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
|``pencil-code/idl/read/pc_read_slice_raw.pro``  | reading of any 2D slice from 3D snapshots  |
+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
|``pencil-code/idl/pc_get_quantity.pro``         | compute physical quantities out of raw data|
+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
|``pencil-code/idl/pc_check_quantities.pro``     | dependency checking of physical quantities |
+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+


in order to read data efficiently and compute quantities in physical
units.

Command-line based data analysis (may be inefficient)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several idl-procedures have been written (see in ‘``pencil-code/idl``’)
to facilitate inspecting the data that can be found in raw format in
‘``jeans-x/data``’. For example, let us inspect the time series data

.. code:: idl 

   IDL> pc_read_ts, obj=ts

The structure ``ts`` contains several variables that can be inspected by

.. code:: idl

   IDL> help, ts, /structure
   ** Structure <911fa8>, 4 tags, length=320, data length=320, refs=1:
      IT              LONG      Array[20]
      T               FLOAT     Array[20]
      UMAX            FLOAT     Array[20]
      RHOMAX          FLOAT     Array[20]

The diagnostic ``UMAX``, the maximal velocity, is available since it was
set in “``jeans-x/print.in``”. Please check the manual for more
information about the input files.

We plot now the evolution of ``UMAX`` after the initial perturbation
that is defined in “``start.in``”:

.. code:: idl 

   IDL> plot, ts.t, alog(ts.umax)

The complete state of the simulation is saved as snapshot files in
“``jeans-x/data/proc0/VAR*``” every ``dsnap`` time units, as defined in
“``jeans-x/run.in``”. These snapshots, for example “``VAR5``”, can be
loaded with:

.. code:: idl

   IDL> pc_read_var, obj=ff, varfile="VAR5", /trimall

Similarly ``tag_names`` will provide us with the available variables:

.. code:: idl

   IDL> print, tag_names(ff)
   T X Y Z DX DY DZ UU LNRHO POTSELF

The logarithm of the density can be inspected by using a GUI:

.. code:: idl

   IDL> cslice, ff.lnrho

Of course, for scripting one might use any quantity from the ``ff``
structure, like calculating the average density:

.. code:: idl

   IDL> print, mean(exp(ff.lnrho))

Python visualization (optional)
-------------------------------

Be advised that the Python support is still not complete or as
feature-rich as for IDL. Furthermore, we move to Python3 in 2020, and
not all the routines have been updated yet.

Python module requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example we use the modules: ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib``. A
complete list of required module is included in
“``pencil-code/python/pencil/README``”.

Using the ’pencil’ module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After sourcing the “``sourceme.sh``” script (see above), you should be
able to import the ``pencil`` module:

::

   import pencil as pc

Some useful functions:
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
|``pc.read.ts``                  | read “``time_series.dat``” file. Parameters are added as members of the class|
+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
``pc.read.slices``              | read 2D slice files and return two arrays: (nslices,vsize,hsize) and (time)|
+------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
|``pc.visu.animate_interactive`` | assemble a 2D animation from a 3D array|
+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+


Some examples of postprocessing with Python can be found in the
:ref:` python documentation <modpython>` and in the :ref:` python tutorials <tutpython>`.
