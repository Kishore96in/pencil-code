# Summary

The Pencil Code is a highly modular physics-oriented simulation code
that can be adapted to a wide range of applications.
It is primarily designed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs)
of compressible hydrodynamics and has lots of add-ons ranging from
astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) [@2010ascl.soft10060B] to
meteorological cloud microphysics [@2017JAMES.9.1116L] and engineering
applications in combustion [@2011JCoPh.230.1B].
Nevertheless, the framework is general and can also be applied to
situations not related to hydrodynamics or even PDEs, for example when
just the message passing interface or input/output strategies of the
code are to be used.
The code can also solve for Lagrangian (inertial and noninertial)
particles, their coagulation and condensation, as well as their
interaction with the fluid.
A related module has also been adapted to perform ray tracing
to solve the eikonal equation.

The code is being used for Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical geometries,
but further extensions are possible.
One can choose between different time stepping schemes and different
spatial derivative operators.
High-order first and second derivatives are used to deal with weakly 
compressible turbulent flows.
There are also different diffusion operators to allow for both direct numerical
simulations (DNS) and various types of large-eddy simulations (LES).

# High-level functionality

An idea about the range of available modules can be obtained by inspecting
the examples under pencil-code/samples/.
Those are low resolution versions related to applications published in the literature.
Some of the run directories of actual production runs are published through Zenodo.
Below a list of method papers that describe the various applications and tests:

* Coagulation and condensation in turbulence [@2008A&A.486.597J; @2017JAMES.9.1116L]
* Radiative transfer [@2006A&A.448.731H; @2014A&A.571A.68B; @2020GApFD.114.162B]
* Chiral magnetic effect in relativistic plasmas [@2018ApJ.858.124S]

* Dust-gas dynamics with mutual drag interaction [@2007ApJ.662.613Y; @2016ApJS.224.39Y]

# Statement of need and purpose of software

The code provides an easily adaptable tool for solving both standard
MHD equations as well as others, such as the test-field equations.
Significant amounts of runtime diagnostics 
as well as Python and IDL libraries for post-processing are available.

Among the currently 83 developers with check-in permission, there are
currently 16 owners who can give others check-in permission.
Of the developers, 34 have done more than 34 commits.
Users have access to the latest development version and can ask to
join the circle of developers by contacting one of the owners.

Every revision on GitHub is verified on 9 tests on travis-ci.com.
The current version is also automatically being tested on 59 hourly
tests and on 79 daily tests.
Continuous progress on the code is driven by the research of
individual developers.

Further developments and interactions between developers and users are
being promoted through annual user meetings since 2004 and a newsletters
since 2020.
Since 2016, a steering committee of five elected owners reviews the
progress and can take decisions of general concern to the Pencil Code
community.

# Key references

The Pencil Code is unique in two ways:
the high level of flexibility and modularity, and the way it is organized
(open source, distributed ownership, openness of development version).

Other software addressing related needs include: 
Athena, CO5BOLD, ENZO, MuRAM, NIRVANA, Stagger, ZEUS, and several other LES codes.
There are also several other engineering DNS codes such as
the Sandia-3-Dimensional (S3D) high-order compressible
optimized for combustion, which is not open source, however.
In addition, there is the Dedalus code, which allows one to
program the equations in symbolic form.

evidenced by the aforementioned document listing all those papers
[@zenodo.3466444], include:
