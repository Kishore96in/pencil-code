# Summary

The Pencil Code is highly modular and can be adapted to a wide
range of applications.
It is primarily designed to solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) of compressible magnetohydrodynamics [@2010ascl.soft10060B],
but the framework is general and can also be applied in situations not
related to PDEs, for example when just the message passing interface or
input/output strategies of the code are to be used.

The code is being used for Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical geometries,
but further extensions are possible.
A preliminary implementation of a Yin--Yang mesh is also in place.
One can choose between different time stepping schemes and different
spatial derivative operators.
There are also different diffusion operators to allow for both direct numerical
simulations (DNS) and various types of large-eddy simulations (LES).

# High-level functionality

An idea about the range of available modules can be obtained by inspecting
the examples under pencil-code/samples/, which include cartesian
convection with Kramers opacities, colliding particles, convection
in a slab, coronae with heatflux and Boris correction, cosmic rays,
cylindrical global disks with a dead zone, photoelectric fluids, dust
in turbulent global disks, gravitational waves, helical MHD turbulence,
implicit resistivity, interlocked fluxrings, interstellar supernova-driven
turbulence, kinematic dynamos, M dwarfs, particles, potential field
boundary condition, sedimentation, sink particles, solar atmosphere,
spherical convection with Kramers opacity, star-in-a-box, superparticles
for condensation-coagulation, nonlinear testfields, ambipolar diffusion,
H2 flame speed tests, reversed field pinch, Boussinesq convection, chiral
dynamos, cylinder deposition with overlayed grid, dynamical alpha effect,
fargo, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, resolved char, shallow water.

Below a list of application that are described in dedicated papers:

* Coagulation and condensation in turbulence [@2008A&A.486.597J; @2017JAMES.9.1116L]
* Radiative transfer [@2006A&A.448.731H; @2014A&A.571A.68B; @2020GApFD.114.162B]
* Chiral magnetic effect in relativistic plasmas [@2018ApJ.858.124S]
* Primordial gravitational waves [@2020GApFD.114.130R]
* Combustion, detonation, and burning particles [@2011JCoPh.230.1B; @Zhang_etal_2020comb; @2020GApFD.114.58Q]
* Test-field method for turbulent MHD transport [@2010PhST.142a4028B]
* Spherical shell convection [@2020GApFD.114.8K]

# Statement of need and purpose of software

The code provides an easily adaptable tool for solving both standard
equations and others, such as the test-field equations.
Significant amounts of runtime diagnostics is available.
Users have access to the latest development version and can ask to
join the circle of developers.
Every revision on GitHub is verified on 9 tests on travis-ci.com.
The current version is also automatically being tested on 59 hourly
tests and on 79 daily tests.
Continuous progress on the code is driven by the research of the
individual developers.
Among the currently 83 developers with check-in permission, there are
currently 16 owners who can give others check-in permission.
Of the developers, 34 have done more than 34 comments.
Further developments and interactions between developers and users is
being promoted through annual user meetings since 2004 and a newsletters
since 2020.
Since 2016, a steering committee of five elected owners reviews the
progress and can take decisions of general concern to the Pencil Code
community.
