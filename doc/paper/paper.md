# Summary

The Pencil Code is a highly modular physics-oriented simulation code
that can be adapted to a wide range of applications.
It is primarily designed to solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) of compressible magnetohydrodynamics [@2010ascl.soft10060B],
but the framework is general and can also be applied to situations not
related to PDEs, for example when just the message passing interface or
input/output strategies of the code are to be used.
The code can also solve for Lagrangian (inertial and noninertial)
particles, their coagulation and condensation, as well as their
interaction with the fluid.

The code is being used for Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical geometries,
but further extensions are possible.
<!--- AB: comment for Joern, and commented out Yin--Yang
A preliminary implementation of a Yin--Yang mesh is also in place.
--->
One can choose between different time stepping schemes and different
spatial derivative operators.
There are also different diffusion operators to allow for both direct numerical
simulations (DNS) and various types of large-eddy simulations (LES).

# High-level functionality

An idea about the range of available modules can be obtained by inspecting
the examples under pencil-code/samples/, which include Cartesian and
spherical shell convection with Kramers opacities, 
solar atmosphere with radiation and ionization, M dwarfs as a star-in-a-box, 
coronae with heatflux and Boris correction, kinematic dynamos,
helical MHD turbulence, implicit resistivity, interlocked fluxrings,
cylindrical global disks with a dead zone, photoelectric fluids, 
dust in turbulent global disks, cosmic rays, gravitational waves
in the early universe, interstellar supernova-driven turbulence,
inertial particles, potential field boundary condition, sedimentation, sink particles, 
superparticles for condensation-coagulation, nonlinear test fields, ambipolar diffusion,
H2 flame speed tests, reversed field pinch, Boussinesq convection, chiral
dynamos, cylinder deposition with overlayed grid, dynamical alpha effect,
fargo, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, resolved reacting char particles, shallow water.

# Statement of need and purpose of software

The code provides an easily adaptable tool for solving both standard
equations as well as others, such as the test-field equations.
Significant amounts of runtime diagnostics are available.
Users have access to the latest development version and can ask to
join the circle of developers.
Every revision on GitHub is verified on 9 tests on travis-ci.com.
The current version is also automatically being tested on 59 hourly
tests and on 79 daily tests.
Continuous progress on the code is driven by the research of the
individual developers.
Among the currently 83 developers with check-in permission, there are
currently 16 owners who can give others check-in permission.
Of the developers, 34 have done more than 34 commits.
Further developments and interactions between developers and users is
being promoted through annual user meetings since 2004 and a newsletters
since 2020.
Since 2016, a steering committee of five elected owners reviews the
progress and can take decisions of general concern to the Pencil Code
community.
