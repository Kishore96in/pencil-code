The Pencil Code
---------------

The Pencil Code moved to
[GitHub](https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code)
on 19 April 2015. It was previously hosted at
[Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/pencil-code/).

In order to checkout the code with
[Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org), use the command
```sh
svn checkout https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code/trunk pencil-code --username <github-username>
```
where `<github-username>` is your GitHub username.

To get started, run one of the samples:
```sh
unix>  cd pencil-code
unix>  source sourceme.csh  [or . sourceme.sh]
unix>  cd samples/conv-slab
unix>  mkdir data
```
To set up the symbolic links and compile the code:
```sh
unix>  pc_setupsrc
unix>  pc_build  [ -f /path/to/config/file.conf ]
```
To create the initial condition and run the code:
```sh
unix>  pc_start  [ -f /path/to/config/file.conf ]
unix>  pc_run    [ -f /path/to/config/file.conf ]
```

See `pencil-code/config/hosts/*/*.conf` for sample config files. For more
details, see the manual in the `doc/` directory (also available
[here](http://pencil-code.nordita.org/)).

If you are using bash and you do not want to "source sourceme.sh" on each
session, you can insert the following into your .bashrc and/or .bash_profile:
```sh
export PENCIL_HOME=$HOME/pencil-code  [or wherever you have the code]
_sourceme_quiet=1; . $PENCIL_HOME/sourceme.sh; unset _sourceme_quiet
```
If you are using csh insert the following into your .cshrc:
```sh
setenv PENCIL_HOME $HOME/pencil-code  [or wherever you have the code]
source $PENCIL_HOME/sourceme.csh
```
