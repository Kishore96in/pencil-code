Dear all,
I have always been submitting the old-fashioned start_run.csh
scripts on any supercomputer, and then I call it usually with
something like

  (echo "";echo $cwd; date) >> $PENCIL_HOME/.run_directories.log; (echo "";date) >> data/jobid.dat; sbatch -A 2019-2-22 -N 32 -n 1024 -t 0:59:00 -J start_run start_run.csh >>data/jobid.dat

where all the extra things help me find afterwards which id corresponds
to which run, even when it is not running yet. I thought the same would
also work with pc_run.

I now hear that many other people use an extra start script, and even
Nils does it. This makes everything very complicated, but he says
he has some tricks to make it simple (some modified pc_newrun script
perhaps?). With this email, I just want to ask the others what they do.
It is not good if everybody has their own private scripts. Such things
could well be made available on pencil-code/utils and explained in
some README file.
